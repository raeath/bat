# Info
This is a repo of all `.bat` files I've created and found that I use often.

They are very janky and despite having some level of comments and documentation, still relies on the fact that I already have and know the switches for [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [ImageMagick](https://github.com/imagemagick/imagemagick) and [F2](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/f2).

I do not expect anyone to see or use this to be honest, however it's nice to have it available in the aether somewhere!
